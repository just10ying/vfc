# vfc

Inputs:
1. Argument 0: .STL file with emitting geometry (these are the triangles that emit the rays)
2. Argument 1: .STL file with receiving geometry (these are the triangles that receive the rays)
3. Argument 2: .STL file with blocking geometry (these triangles can block rays.  Note that the above geometries are not automatically assumed to block rays.)
